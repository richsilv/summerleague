		The main event is a 5 mile or 10km race which covers all standards and is based at a park local to the host club. Following the main event there is a shorter 'tenderfoot' (1.5-2km) race suitable for children, runners returning from injury and runners who prefer to run a shorter distance. Finally there is a series of optional, light hearted, age graded, 300-400m relays, again suitable for all ages and abilities.
